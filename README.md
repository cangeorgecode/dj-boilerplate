# Django Boilerplate
Disclaimer: I am a self-taught programmer, so the code I wrote is not the best

# What is this?
I have always wanted to build an SaaS and make money online. I thought it would be more efficient if I could re-use some of the code for features that are common across all SaaS's. The boilerplate here consists of:

- Built-in authentication system 
- Stripe payment
- Tailwind CSS
- HTMX for async functions

# How to use?
- You need to have python and Node.js installed on your computer
- To install Node.js, go to: https://nodejs.org/en/download/package-manager
- ```git clone https://github.com/cangeorgecode/dj-boilerplate.git```
- Start your virtual environment
- cd into the directory and install requirements.txt
- ``` pip install -r requirements.txt ```

- Install and start Tailwind
``` python manage.py tailwind install```
``` python manage.py tailwind start```

- In a new terminal, 
``` python manage.py runserver```
